# Week 1 – Capstone Planning + Learning System Setup

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the project scope, audience, constraints, and success criteria for the capstone project.  
- Set up the note-to-website publishing pipeline (**Obsidian → GitHub → Quartz → nishadalal.com**).  
- Learn core **LLM app architecture** components.  

---

## 📘 Concepts Learned
- **Foundation models** – capabilities, limitations, use cases.  
- **LangChain basics** – when and why to use.  
- **Core LLM app architecture** – orchestrator, LLM, post-processing, output rendering.  
- **Version control with Git & GitHub Actions** for automated publishing.  

---

## 📊 Facts Learned
- Examples of popular foundation models: GPT-4o, Claude, LLaMA-3, Mistral.  
- Key differences between **fine-tuning** vs **prompt engineering**.  
- What “tokens” mean and why context length matters.  
- How Quartz builds and deploys static sites from Markdown content.  

---

## 🔧 Procedures Practiced
- Configure Obsidian vault for **learning-notes** repo.  
- Install & configure Quartz in the repo.  
- Set up `.gitignore` to prevent private notes from publishing.  
- Write first Markdown blog post in `/content/blog/` and deploy to nishadalal.com.  
- Create **capstone project design doc** with:
  - Requirements
  - Expected features
  - Target audience
  - Constraints & tech stack
- Diagram LLM app architecture in **Mermaid**.
